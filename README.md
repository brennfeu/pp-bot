## __RULES :__

Each turn, each people use D50+DEX. The bigger one only attacks the other. If the results are the same, both people attack.


An attack does 10 + (STR of the attacker)/10 damage to the STR value. You can also use a big punch, which has -10 DEX and +100 STR. Or you can try to hit the vital point of your enemy's pp : -30 DEX, insta-kill.

You can also heal yourself or stop the fight and high five. If you both high five, you both wins !

Forbidden move : Kick ! 


When a STR value is at 0 or below, it means you lost !
